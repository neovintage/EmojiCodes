# Emoji for Textual

If you haven't heard, [Textual](http://www.codeux.com/textual/) is a great IRC client for MacOS.  One thing that I missed from using Campfire was all of the sweet [Emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).  This bundle adds that back in.

Unfortunately, this doesn't build any package to help install it for you.  Maybe I'll do that in another release.

## Installation

* Download project
* Build it
* Copy EmojiCode.bundle
* Find Textual in your Applications directory and 'Show Package Contents'
* Paste EmojiCode.bundle in Contents/Resources/Extensions
